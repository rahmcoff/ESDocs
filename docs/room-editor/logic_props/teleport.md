# Teleport

![Teleport Selector](./img/Teleport-Selector.png)

A logic prop that can change the player position. When this logic prop is triggered the player(s) will be teleported to the position of the prop.

### :small_orange_diamond:Teleport All Players
<div className="highlight-div">
When checked, all players will be teleported to this teleport position. When not checked, only one player is teleported.
</div>

Use this if you want to teleport all players when this Teleport logic prop is triggered.



### :small_orange_diamond:Change Rotation On Teleport
<div className="highlight-div">
When checked, teleported players will face the direction this teleport is pointing at. When not checked, the players keep their previous rotations.
</div>

You can use this to force a player to look in a certain direction.

:::tip
To make teleportation more smooth, the teleporter can be set a bit deeper into the ground.
