# Skybox

![Skybox Selector](./img/Skybox-Selector.png)

The Logic prop that changes the sky around the room. You can add your own images or use the procedurally generated sky by setting the colors yourself. You can also change the skybox during gameplay by triggering another skybox at a later time. Only one skybox can be activated at a time. Triggering another skybox will hide the previous skybox.
